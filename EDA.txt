1. Whenever you see a a categorical data , try to do first  is countplot 
    sns.countplot(x="", data = df )
    Categorical data = which you can categorise 0 = false , 1 = true 
2. For Pie chart 
df["Survived"].value_counts().plot(kind="pie",autopct= "%.2f")

Eigen vectors = it is that vector in which if you perform linear transformation then the direction stays the same , the magnitude may change 
suppose  a matrix [3 1]
                  [0 2]

Eigen value = how much the value (maginitude) changed after the transformation
